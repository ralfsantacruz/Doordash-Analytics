# Doordash-Analytics

This is a repository that holds the work I have done for the Take-Home assignment for DoorDash.

Here is a link to a short Tableau dashboard that I created to supplement my answer to the first part of the assignment:

In that dashboard, I was able to glean information about people who receive discounts and how much they tip. People who receive disounts are more prone to tip, and generally tend to tip a little higher as the discount goes up. While the increase is not as high as one would have thought, I would propose a feature that could notify the customer who received a hefty disocunt to encourage them to tip a little bit higher. 
Another suggestion to the product will be to potentially have a feature that will shave off some of the customer's discount to allow for a higher tip. A caveat to this is that the discount must be high enough so that the customer still feels like they are receiving a good deal. 

A couple of upsides to this:
* The driver receives extra compensation. Extra compensation will increase retention rate of Dashers.
* Customer is already receiving a discount, so it is not a huge blow to their wallet.

 I used Jupyter Notebook along with Pandas and Matplotlib to generate the plots below:
 I went ahead and took it a step further and calculated the difference in time from when the customer places their order to when they receive their food to uncover some insights on how customers spend.
